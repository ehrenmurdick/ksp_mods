Buffalo MSEV - Explore Space In Style

The NASA Multimission Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) Is a radical new concept that uses common components for ground rovers and in-space exploration craft. This modularity opens up the possibility of a variety of different configurations. The Buffalo Modular Space Exploration Vehicle (MSEV) is the KSP equivalent from Wild Blue Industries. With the Buffalo, you can explore space in style!

Features
- Modular design lets you build rovers, aircraft, and spacecraft.
- Fits inside the standard 3.75m cargo bay.
- KIS/KAS friendly; you can assemble and disassemble the Buffalo out in the field.
- Crew spaces have IVAs with support for stock as well as ASET Props/ASET Avionics.
- Designs inspired by real-world NASA MMSEV with family resemblance to ground vehicles around KSC.

Recommended Mods (you'll need RPM as well as ASET Props and ASET Avionics to use the Buffalo Command Cab's ASET IVA)

Note: The current parts list lets you create a rover, but future updates will expand the parts list for more options.

---INSTALLATION---

Copy the contents of the mod's GameData directory into your GameData folder. Specifically you'll need:

CommunityResourcePack
WildBlueIndustries/000WildBlueTools
WildBlueIndustries/Buffalo
ModuleManager.dll (the latest version is included)

If these directories already exist, then delete the existing ones before installing the latest update.

---REVISION HISTORY---

0.2.2

Flatbeds
- Removed KIS part mount module; it was only applicable to a small number of parts.
- You can now surface-attach parts to the flatbeds.

Buckboards
- Anybody can now stack Buckboards.

Other
- Updated to KSP 1.0.5

0.2.1

Bug Fixes
- Added collider to broken wheel mesh on the M1A1.

0.2.0

The Buffalo gets new wheels! The stock-based RoveMax M1A1 wheels were always interim placeholders, but now the Buffalo has its real wheels. The new M1A1 Mountain Goat is inspired by the wheels found on NASA’s MMSEV but they have been brought inline with the KSP art style. The current stock-based wheel will be going away. They are deprecated in this release (existing craft won’t break but you won’t find the wheels in the catalog) and it will be removed at a later date, so be sure to retrofit or retire your rovers that have the older wheels.

New Parts
- Added the M1A1 Mountain Goat. The M1A1 can switch between a wide wheelbase for normal driving, and a narrow wheelbase to get in and out of cargo bays. And to top it off, it has sound effects if you have the Wheel Sounds mod installed. Thanks for the suggestion, Supermarine! :)

- Added the Tundra 200 and Tundra 400. These are conformal storage tanks for the Buffalo that are intended for aerospace craft. Unlike the Wagon, they do not expand, but you can attach other parts to them.

Interim Rover Wheel
- The existing stock-based rover wheel has been deprecated in favor of the new M1A1 Omni Wheel. Be sure to retrofit your rovers.

Command Cab
- Increased storage slots slightly.

0.1.5

This update has more bug fixes and some minor tweaks.

Chassis
- Increased the Chassis 2u KIS storage to 200L.
- Decreased the Chassis End Unit KIS storage to 80L.

Crew Cab
- Adjusted the default EVA airlock to the right side, just like the command cab.
- Adjusted the ladder colliders to make it easier to climb up.

Command Cab
- Adjusted the ladder colliders to make it easier to climb up.

Other
- Updated to the latest version of Community Resource Pack and Module Manager.
- Converted textures to DDS.

0.1.4
This update has a couple of bug fixes- gotta reduce that technical debt!

- The MC-3000 now has the correct amount of KIS storage when storing something other than KIS items. NOTE: You'll need to switch our your resources for this change to take effect.
- Fixed an issue with the AuxEN that prevented AntennaRange from working correctly.

0.1.3

With this update, the Buffalo also gets some new additions; some mini RCS motors (with sound effects!) and a couple of animated arms (static animations, sorry) to help with asteroid exploration. There's also a couple of bug fixes for the Wagon and Buckboards, the graphics glitch with the crew cab has been fixed. Sorry, no custom wheels- yet.

New parts
- Added the 5-Way Mini RCS Thruster. This is particularly helpful for exploration craft maneuvering around large objects like asteroids. It even has sound effects! You can change the volume or disable the sound effects by opening the Settings window. To do that, press Mod B simultaneously (Mod is the Modifier key, which defaults to Alt on Windows).

- Added the Buffalo Grappler Arm. Just like the stock Advanced Grabbing Unit, the Grappler Arm is useful for grabbing things like asteroids.

- Added the Asteroid Resource Composition Scanner (ARCS). This arm works like the stock Surface Scanning Module, but only for asteroids. However, it tells you the entire composition of an asteroid instead of just its Ore content. Simply right-click on the part and click Scan Asteroid to get its composition.

Buffalo Crew Cab & Wagon
- The integrated solar panels are now more durable. If the solar panel breaks, so has your part.

Buffalo Command Cab
- Increased the crash tolerance slightly and made it consistent with the Wagon and Crew Cab.

Chassis End Unit
- Added a storage tank with some storage capacity.

Buckboards
- Buckboards show up in the Buffalo parts category again.

Bug Fixes
- Increased the Wagon's storage slot capacity to 8x8.
- All Buckboards can now be mounted to the flatbeds.
- You can now see out of both windows in the crew cabin from either seat.

0.1.2

This release fixes a number of issues that resulted from separating the Buffalo out of Pathfinder. It also introduces two new Buckboard storage containers, and a couple of new parts for the Buffalo. Finally, the Buffalo Crew Cabin and Buffalo Command Cab have been improved.

New Parts
- Added MC-2000 Buckboard and MC-3000 Buckboard. With colliders and glowing resource decals. ;)
- Added the Auxiliary Electronic Navigator (AuxEN). In the Old West, oxen were frequently used to pull wagons. The AuxEN doesn't pull anything, but it does the driving. The probe core is the same size as a Chassis 1u, and supports RemoteTech, AntennaRange, and kOS.
- Added an adapter that tapers from the Buffalo cab form factor to a 1.25m cylinder. 

Buffalo Command cab
- Widened the headlight beams and angled them down slightly for better ground operations.
- You can now toggle the headlights separately from the cabin lights. Both cabin lights and headlights will turn on when you tap on the Lights button.

Buffalo Crew Cab
- Reworked the crew cab to include doors and ladders on its sides.
- Added a small amount of inventory space.

Bug Fixes
- The Buckboard MC-1000's decal glows again.
- Fixed file paths for several Buffalo parts so they'll show up again.
- Moved Trailer Hitch to Utility.
- Moved Chassis Decoupler to Structural.

0.1.1

Bug Fixes
- Fixed a collider issue with the Buckboard.
- Kerbals will now orient properly when going on EVA from the crew cabin.
- Made it easier to enter the crew cabin when climbing up the trailer hitch.
- The Chassis Decoupler will now show up properly in the parts catalog.
- The KAS Pipe ID labels now glow properly.

0.1.0 Where The Buffalo Roam
