	@description =  The SETI GreenHouse, made by famous designer zzz, provides 100% of the Food and Oxygen, but only 90% of the Water for up to 1 kerbal. As input resources, it uses all the CarbonDioxide, WasteWater and Waste of 1 kerbal, in addition to Electric Charge and Nutrients, which can be converted from Food. So per kerbal (up to 1 per greenhouse) you only need to supply 10% of the usual amount of Water and 20% of the usual amount of Food, to fulfil all their Oxygen, Water and Food needs. Transporting Nutrients directly is twice as mass efficient as converting them from Food (different container dry masses).
